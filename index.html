        <p>Starting with limited digital basics in my life, I am positively surprised by my current level of knowledge, reflecting on the entire semester. Step by step, we started programming, first with HTML, then with CSS,  p5.js and partly C++ in the end. It wasn't always easy, as we had to learn completely new language systems, but it was very motivating to see visual results straight away. I didn't start my studies at the HBK knowing that I was about to learn how  to programme, but I'm now happy to have had and continue to have the opportunity to learn how to design digitally. I have learnt a lot about programming languages in general, e.g. how the computer receives, evaluates and executes commands and how precise the commands or algorithms sometimes have to be. I also learnt about several specific programming languages and their tasks, e.g. when creating a website. I also gained an insight into digital colour systems and the structure of simple electronic devices. Apart from the digital basics, I also feel more confident in working with digital media in general, feel more confident and see many advantages of using digital resources in design or combining analogue and digital aspects.
