            <h2 class="secondtitle">In Reflection</h2>
            <p>After initial programming attempts with HTML and CSS on Codepen, we continued with p5.js and a corresponding project: Perspective. From a given selection of terms, we each selected five terms and visualised them using p5.js. In the following, I implemented Proportion, Overlap, Detail, Shadow and Occlusion in perspective. The process turned out to be rather difficult at first, as I had to guess each point in the p5.js coordinate system, which I was not yet familiar with, and then kept changing numbers to adjust parameters. Replacing the numbers with relative values in the second step required another mathematical rethink, but was much easier to handle in retrospect. To start with, I kept the perspective representations very simple, but I would like to tackle more complex representations next time. I learnt how shapes work in the p5.js coordinate system and what happens when different parameters are changed, fixed values as well as relative values.</p>
