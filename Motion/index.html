            <h2 class="secondtitle">In Reflection</h2>
            <p>The next project, Motion, was linked to a new work platform. This meant a change from the very easy-to-use, playful codepen to the professional, more straightforward VS Code. I struggled with this change at first, as I had to find my way around the many windows and interaction options, as well as the push and pull system via GitHub Desktop. In reflection, however, I have to say that the programme seems more confusing at first than it actually is in the end. Again we chose five terms from a given selection, in my case ‘against each other’, ‘turnaround’, ‘apart’, ‘all around’, and ‘catch up’. We then implemented these concepts visually, working mainly in java script`s ‘function draw’. The most interesting to me was learning how simple animations work which, however, reflect general principles that can be applied often (laws of animation).</p>
