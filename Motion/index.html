            <h2 class="secondtitle">In Reflection</h2>
            <p>The next project, Motion, was linked to a new work platform. This meant a change from the very easy-to-use, playful codepen to the professional, more straightforward VS Code. I struggled with this change at first, as I had to find my way around the many windows and interaction options, as well as the push and pull system via GitHub Desktop. On reflection, however, I have to say that the programme, like many other programmes, seems more confusing at first than it actually is in the end. As usual, we chose five terms from a given selection, in my case ‘against each other’, ‘turnaround’, ‘apart’, ‘all around’, and ‘catch up’. I learned how simple animations work (laws of animation), digitally with a focus on the function draw area in p5.js.</p>
