        <strong>Phase 1</strong>
        <p>A circle of varying size in each corner of a square. The circles are connected by a long line.</p>

        <strong>Phase 2</strong>
        <p>A circle of varying size in each corner of a four-sided square. The circles are connected by a smaller four-sided square whose corners lie within the centres of the circles.</p>

        <strong>Phase 3</strong>
        <p>A circle of varying size in each corner of a rectangle. The circles are connected by a smaller rectangle whose corners lie exactly within the centres of the circles.</p>

        <strong>Phase 4</strong>
        <p>A circle of the same size in each corner of a rectangle. The circles are connected by a smaller rectangle whose corners are exactly inside the centres of the circles.</p>

        <strong>Phase 5</strong>
        <p>A circle of the same size in each corner of a rectangle. The circles are connected by a smaller rectangle whose corners are exactly inside the centres of the circles. Repeat the same principle, getting smaller and smaller, until there is no more space.</p>

        <p>
          The semester began with an introductory task into the world of digital language. We looked at the term ‘algorithm’ and then created and developed our own analogue algorithms. We had several fellow students run these algorithms after each step and observed what similarities and differences there were, to what extent the algorithm created restrictions and to what extent it left room for interpretation. We then adapted the algorithms again and again according to preference and/or our own vision. I experienced this task as a pleasant introduction that helped me to understand digital processes in a relaxed, playful way. This was particularly helpful for me, as I had previously avoided rather than sought out contact with coding and programming languages and first had to familiarise myself with its content.
